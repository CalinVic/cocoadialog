CocoaDialog 2.0.0 has been released.
It includes an exciting new "bubble" dialog, secure (password) text entries, bug fixes, and fixes for some of the annoyances in previous versions.

Visit the homepage at http://cocoadialog.sourceforge.net
and also be sure to check out the updated documentation at http://cocoadialog.sourceforge.net/documentation.html

Important backwards-compatibility note:
* I broke compatibility of the dropdown dialog with previous versions!  Now, when no buttons are pressed as a result of --exit-onchange, it returns a 4 for the button instead of 0.  The 0 is now returned for timeouts.

Detailed changes include:
* Added bubble dialog.
* Added secure modes for inputbox and standard-inputbox.
* The application now runs as a background app. This means no more annoying 
  menu or dock icon!
* Some dialogs can be floated above all other applications.
* Timeouts on several dialogs.
* Intelligent button resizing
* Added custom icon support to msgbox, ok-msgbox, and standard-msgbox.
* Added --help options (still needs improvement).
* Added --select-only-directories to fileselect.
* Restructured project directory, code hierarchy, and refactored much of the code.
* Cleaned up the look of several dialogs.
* Progressbar won't be displayed right away, to prevent showing for
  very short operations.
* Bug fixes (string-input on inputboxes, missing deallocs).
* New application icon.

Many, many thanks are needed for this release.  Almost everything in it comes from others' contributions.
* Wout Mertens - Wout's nearly 1300 line patch is available (though flagged as closed) on the sf.net project page.  Most notably this included switching CocoaDialog to a background application, adding the ability to float dialogs above other windows, and timeouts.
* Allan Odgaard - Allan cleaned up the look of the progressbar and added a delay so short invocations won't bother showing it, added button resizing, cleaned up the inputboxes, and more.
* Laurent Baumann http://www.cubes.fr - Laurent permitted the use of his beautiful bezel icons for bubble dialog's stock icons, as well as for the application icon.
